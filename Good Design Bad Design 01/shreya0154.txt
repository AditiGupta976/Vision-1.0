1) The given design is bad because it's not appealing and easy to use.
2) The components are not properly placed.
3) Complete Login section including "agent login" button should be at one place for ease of access.
4) The "Agent Login" button is not placed correctly. I changed its position.
5) I also changed its color to an eye catching color which, I guess, fits perfectly on the theme of app.
6) The MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE, which I personally face while using such app or website, is the gap between two buttons or links. It's quite irritating when we have to struggle with clicking properly on the link/button we want.
7) I tried to resolve that too.
8) The text in "more apps" section is coming out of the box which is not looking good and professional.
9) Changed the color of "forgot pin" and "register" link.


10) In the second design (of search page), I don't think there needs to be any change.
11) Everything is present with proper colouration, size of buttons and boxes, gaps, on the same page. 
12) User needs not to switch between pages for these correlated information (which is given on that page).
